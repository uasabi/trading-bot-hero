intro
  - how I am
  - what I do
    - uasabi ltd
  - cristiano & cf
  - won't share details :D

3 main arguments:

1. basic trading in simple terms
  - what to trade
    - forex, stock, future
  - where to trade
  - basic exchanges, CF, bitstamp, IB
  - strategies
    - buy high, sell low
    - arbitrage
    - market making
    - roll your own (AI)

1. how to build application that trades on the market
  - event based
    - ticker feed
    - elm architecture
      - record/replay
  - why functional
    - no state
    - lambdas
  - redux architecture
    - CQRS
    - redux loop
    - actors & akka

1. how to test like a pro
  - why do you even bother
  - typescript as a testing tool
  - unit testing with tape
    - why not jest, ava, etc.
  - unit testing with data
  - integration
  - snapshot testing
    - record/replay
  - ci/cd

outro
  - what does it look like?
  - does it work?
  - next?
